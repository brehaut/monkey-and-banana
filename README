# monkey-and-banana

This project contains some variations on the classic [Monkey and Banana
problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_and_banana_problem). I
have based my solution on the text and sample provided on pg 46 of
Ivan Bratko's *PROLOG Programming for Artifical Intelligence*. This
project is meant to accompany a blog post. Each variation of the
program transitions further from the raw functional solution toward a
logical one.

If you have not attempted to solve this problem in your language of
choice, I would recommend doing so.

## Usage

load the various modules up in your repl and explore them. If you just
want to read the code, check the documentation produced by marginalia
in `docs/`.
